# diamond-docker

An attempt at bringing [Diamond Wiki](https://github.com/saalaa/diamond) to
Docker.

It's pretty much a work in progress for now but the intent is to get it working
nicely with standalone Docker as well as Rancher.


## Caveats

- A `pypi` package should be used for installation
- Rancher configuration should be provided
- More documentation for using this repository is needed
- Loading fixtures is currently not possible
